# My Own To do App
This is a to do application that I wrote independently. I got the design idea from courses, canva and pinterest. I got the idea for the functionality from courses and my ideas.


During this project, I practiced:
- building the site on my own without the help of tutorials
- adding and removing css classes 
- event delegation
- key shortcuts 
- save data in local storage
- divide js file into smaller parts
- node.js
- npm(e.g. gulp, cssnano, uglify. kit, sourcemaps, rename, browser-sync)
- splitting the .html file into .kit modules
- splitting the file structure into src(source) and dist(distribution)

Functionality used: 
- drop-down, responsive sidebar
- information about no tasks displayed when number of tasks = 0
- adding tasks using button or enter key
- editing tasks 
- marking tasks as done
- changing user avatar and user name in settings
- saving current state in local storage
