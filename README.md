# My Own To do App
This is a to do application that I wrote independently. I got the design idea from canva and pinterest. I got the idea for the functionality from courses and my ideas.


During this project, I practiced:
- building the site on my own without the help of tutorials
- adding and removing css classes 
- event delegation
- key shortcuts 

Functionality used: 
- drop-down, responsive sidebar
- information about no tasks displayed when number of tasks = 0
- adding tasks using button or enter key
- editing tasks 
- marking tasks as done
